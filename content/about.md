      - name: "Security"
        code: "PLAN 1"
        desc: "Ever since I was very young, I found security fascinating—especially terms like vulnerabilities, reports, threat intelligence, and alerts, which all sounded really cool to me, almost like having the power to protect the world. <br><br> This passion led me to receive a CNVD identifier while still in elementary school, and I earned my first bug bounty at the age of 19. In the future, I hope to achieve a CVE identifier before I turn 30, marking a milestone in the next decade of my life."
      - name: "Full-stack development"
        code: "PLAN 2"
        desc: "This is where my journey into coding began. Although many people think frontend and backend development are simple, they are fields with very high ceilings. For example, writing a basic HTML/CSS page is frontend, but creating something like a React JavaScript library is also frontend. Similarly, for the backend, implementing a simple CRUD operation counts as backend, while designing a distributed architecture is also backend. <br><br> The reason I chose to learn both frontend and backend is that I realized security is fundamentally based on code, and I wanted to improve my coding skills. Although I focus on frontend and backend, I am gradually learning about client-side development as well. The frontend ecosystem is convenient for cross-platform work, but I chose to learn Qt."
      - name: "Design"
        code: "PLAN 3"
        desc: "At first, I wanted to learn design because I dreamed of creating cool interfaces like those from big companies, or something like in sci-fi movies. For that, I learned Figma, Blender, and C4D, even AE. But back then, I was only chasing “coolness,” and ended up getting stuck in a kind of self-indulgent phase.<br><br>Still, I really enjoyed that so-called self-indulgent experience. Since my life wasn’t going well and many people saw me as useless, the only way I could satisfy myself was by creating things that looked cool and high-end to me.<br><br>Fortunately, I’ve now moved past that stage, and I try to focus on making simple designs instead.<br><br>It’s worth mentioning that many of my friends, and even career opportunities, have mostly come through my design work."
      - name: "Animation"
        code: "PLAN 4"
        desc: "This is a time-consuming industry that requires mastering the principles of motion as well as image processing (for example, using Adobe Photoshop to separate an illustrator’s artwork, and sometimes even developing some drawing skills yourself). Then, with tools like Spine or After Effects, you bring the artwork to life, sometimes even adding special effects.<br><br>This industry is closely connected with film, animation, and even the gaming field, where animation can be used to create beautiful interactions or even full game projects.<br><br>I enjoy games, 2D and 3D anime works, as well as CG, and I even dream of creating a game of my own. That’s why I started learning animation."
      - name: "Technical-Art"
        code: "PLAN 5"
        desc: "I only came to fully understand this after getting into animation. Before that, I had tried using Unreal Engine, and even created a Mario-like game with Unity. The work of a technical artist often focuses more on effects and animation, adding a more refined quality to visuals. You could say it’s an area I got into as a byproduct of learning animation."

A person with no education, no professional certificates, and not even any background. Has considerable interest in security, design, technical art, and software development, but only as a hobby rather than with professional rigor. Focused on implementing functionality, achieving desired effects, or accomplishing specific goals, rather than pursuing perfection.
