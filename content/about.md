#about
Fail,being laughed at, is my life.

#contributiondes
\*I'm well aware that my understanding of design, development, and security is not yet sufficient.

Therefore, all experiences before 2024 are flawed to some extent, and I plan to address these shortcomings as I continue to learn and grow.

#end
failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.<br>
失败无可厚非；重要的是拾起继续前行的勇气。
